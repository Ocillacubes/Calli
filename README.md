# Calli
A garbage calendar developed as practice for JunPogOS

## Why should I use this over cal
You really shouldn't

## Why is the code so bad
I literally just started learning C yesterday please forgive me

## Known bugs
So some weird stuff happens with different centuries in figuring out the first day of the year so that's something I'm working on
